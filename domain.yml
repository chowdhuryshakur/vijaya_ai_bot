     Sure, let me check availability. How about scheduling your diagnostic centre appointment on the upcoming {day_name} {period_name}? 
     If that suits you, we can proceed with the booking.

      I recommend checking with the diagnostic centre directly for the allocated slots for doctor's appointments, 
      as the availability may vary. They can provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information on available
      time slots.
